# Predictive Diagnosis App – MeldRx Predictive AI App Challenge

## Overview

The **Predictive Diagnosis App** aims to revolutionize healthcare decision-making by utilizing AI and machine learning models to predict patient diagnoses. This app harnesses the power of predictive analytics and seamlessly integrates with healthcare systems using the SMART on FHIR standard. By delivering accurate predictions and recommendations based on real-time health data, the app empowers healthcare professionals to make more informed and timely decisions, improving patient care and outcomes.

## Features

- **Predictive Diagnostics**: Uses machine learning models to predict patient conditions based on input health data.
- **FHIR Compliance**: Built to integrate with healthcare systems using HL7 FHIR® R4 format and SMART on FHIR standards.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Delivers actionable insights such as recommended treatments, further tests, and potential risks based on data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connects with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using SMART on FHIR or CDS Hooks for easy implementation.
- **Data Security**: Ensures patient data privacy and complies with healthcare regulations.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React for the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **Backend**: Node.js for handling data processing and API calls.
- **Machine Learning**: Python-based machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- **FHIR Integration**: MeldRx platform for seamless FHIR-first backend integration.
  
## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: The app receives patient data in the FHIR R4 format from EHRs via the MeldRx platform.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: AI models analyze historical and real-time data to generate predictions.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Based on the analysis, the app generates personalized recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and further tests.
4. **Integration**: The app integrates with other healthcare systems via SMART on FHIR, enabling it to work seamlessly across diverse platforms.
5. **Real-Time Updates**: The app continuously updates its predictions as new patient data becomes available.
